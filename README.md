This is the Capstone Project of LC Waikiki Test Automation Bootcamp. 

In this project, I automated a customer usage scenario.

Test Case is:
Login, Choose Blouse from Women Category and Black Colour for Filter. Click first available and add a M size
product to cart. Then go to cart and payment pages respectively. Check every variable, label, price etc.
